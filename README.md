# Guild Wars 2 Addons Repository
### Description

A list of validated addons compatible with the [GW2 Addon Loader](https://github.com/gw2-addon-loader/loader-core), to be used with the [GW2 Addon Manager](https://github.com/gw2-addon-loader/GW2-Addon-Manager).

The objective of this list is to provide a comprehensive list of add-ons that work with the GW2 Addon Loader and GW2 Addon Manager as well as provide descriptive `update.yaml` files for each.

`update.yaml` is intended to serve as a consistent source of information to both the addon manager and the addon loader for configuration, installation, chain loading, etc. of any addon.

A template file can be found here, as well as existing folders displaying what a completed `update.yaml` file looks like in practice.

### How to Add Your Addon

Submit a PR where you add a folder with the name of your addon (preferably in relatively short and basic form, e.g. `gw2radial` or `arcdps_bhud`) with a completed `update.yaml` file within. See the `d912pxy` example as a rough guideline.

### Usage

If you'd like to use this curated list for your own purposes, you can use the [landing page](https://gw2-addon-loader.github.io/addon-repo/) or the [master JSON file](https://gw2-addon-loader.github.io/addon-repo/addons.json). The JSON file is updated hourly.
