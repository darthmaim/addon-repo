    "A companion plugin to ArcDPS that allows you to organize a list of saved builds and copy them with one click.\n\nIt detects your ArcDPS templates and converts them (automatically and/or manually) to GW2 templates. Your old gear templates, which cannot be pasted into GW2, can be previewed inside the plugin so you can remind yourself which items and stats you had saved."
